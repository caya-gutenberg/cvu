## What is the Internal Bank?
Just like traditional banks, it would function as a bank but will only lend internally to members and hold in escrow funds that where contributed by members both for a reasonable fee.

## How is the bank funded?
Funding comes primarily from passive income and earnings from the products it offers.

## What are those passive income?
Donations from members, earned interest from used bank account for the fund, rebates from ING, CIMB, GCash, Paymaya, coins.ph etc.

## What are the current products?
For now, only:
1. Loans - for members and first-come first-served basis
2. Escrow Service - Holds members contribution and invests on it's behalf

## Are there requirements to avail of a loan?
Must be a member of the group and availed on a first-come first-serve basis since funds are currently limited.

## What are the fees for the loan?

### Normal Rate:
* **Interest:** 3.5% good for 30 days;
* **Penalty:** 0.35% after 30 days every 5 days or fraction thereof

### Flexi-Rate:
* *1 to 10th day:* 1.5%
* *11th to 20th day:* 1.5%

## What are the terms of the loan?
The loan can be used for anything. If fund is still needed beyond expected term, roll it. Just follow the rules on rolling funds. Flexi-terms is also in place, see details about it below.

## What is rolling use of funds?
Rolling is defined as use of funds beyond 30 days with interest paid prior to 30th day or flexi-term interest was availed. 
Failure to pay the corresponding interest within the 30th day would mean incurring the penalty rate.

## When does the counting of 30 days start for rolled loan?
Counting for 30 days starts from the next calendar day after interest or interest with penalty was paid.

## What is flexi-terms?
Flexi-terms is a buit-in feature of the loan, meaning, no registration needed. Flexi-terms means, you pay the interest every 10 days.
Meaning, if you can pay the loan in 10th day, you only incur 1.5%. Paying on the 20th means you also get to pay additional 1.5%.
Take note that this is only effective for the 1st to 20th day or a total of 3.0% interest. After that, interest rate will automatically be the normal rate (see fees above) and penalty if beyond.

## Any rules on penalty?
0.35% penalty is counted every 5 days. So in 30days, you will have a total of 2.1% penalty. Pay it together with the intended interest and your loan will become clean and be marked as rolled.

## Is there limit on the loan amount?
Yes, minumum and maximum is Php500 at this time. Minimum will be raised to Php600 to be equal to each member's monthly contribution once 80% of total bank funding becomes Php3,600 or higher.

## Is there a limit on the number of months to roll the loaned amount?
None for now. Just comply with the terms.

## Is it still possible to get a loan when limit is hit?
Yes, it is possible through what is called Overlimit.

## What is Overlimit?
Overlimit is defined as going over the maximum loanable amount. Done with consent of one member waiving his/her right to use such fund for a maximum of 1 month. Waiver expires in month and has to be renewed.

## Is there an Overlimit limit?
As of this time, overlimit limit is double the max loanable amount or Php1,000 total.
Normal monthly interest, flexi-terms, and penalty applies to the whole loan amount.

## Is there an Overlimit Fee?
Yes, there is a flat rate 0.5% (or Php2.50 calculated against the current limit per loan) per member waiving his/her.
As of this time, limit is 1 but in the future, it could be 5 or 7 depending on funds availability.

This fee is deducted immediately and the disbursed amount is less than this fee (e.g. Php 497.50 for Php500 overlimit approved).

## How much is the escrow fee?
5% of the net earnings to where the funds are invested.
