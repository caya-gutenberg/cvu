      <description>What are the veggies there? Currently planted with ampalaya.
How many unit areas where planted? Per discussion, 2.
Planting capacity? Not sure, maybe 4 but given the current funds limitation, only 2 where utilized.
So how about idle areas? Anyone from the member with personal extra funds can utilize those idle areas. Better for it to be utilized than just lay idle. Group gets nothing for now.</description>
